# ImageCaptioning
This repository contains the implementation of an Image Captioning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks in PyTorch. The model is trained and evaluated on the Flickr dataset, which consists of images paired with their corresponding captions.
